A contractor in a regulated industry — good at the work, bad at the follow-up. Clients fell through the cracks not because of capability, but because the system for staying in touch didn't exist.

The typical consultant pitch would be: "Here's a CRM. Go use it." That doesn't work for someone whose actual constraint is time and habit, not software awareness.

Instead, we mapped the daily workflow — what actually happens between meetings, calls, and paperwork — and designed a follow-up system using AI tools the contractor could run in the gaps. Not a new platform. Tools layered into the rhythm that already existed.
