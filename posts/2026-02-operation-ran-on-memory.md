A trailer manufacturer with 40+ units per month, two production facilities, and a quoting process that required 60+ minutes of manual correction per build.

The item master had multiple numbering systems. The die number reference was 90% wrong. Build instructions lived in verbal orders and handwritten sheets. One person held the entire data structure in her head — and she was drowning.

We didn't know their ERP system before we started. We learned it because that's what the problem required. Over two months, we validated 537 item codes, rebuilt the die map from scratch, digitized flatbed order intake (replacing 250+ handwritten PDFs), and documented processes across both facilities.

The result: a system designed to generate accurate BOMs without manual correction, enable barcode-driven tracking, and scale with volume without adding office headcount.

## What It Demonstrates

Discovery matters more than pre-packaged expertise. The client already had the knowledge — it was trapped in one person's head and scattered across paper systems. Our job was to ask the right questions, extract the knowledge, and build something that survives turnover.
